When downloading the project be sure to run:
```
npm install 
```
Since we have a .gitignore file that ignores node_modules, .DS_Store and our distribution folder

## Local Development:
To start the project in your local environment, run the following:
```
npm run start
```

## Deployment:
The project current uses webpack to bundle the code, and compiles it into the 'dist' folder;  You can do this by running the following:
```
npm run build
```
Then place the browser ready files onto your server
